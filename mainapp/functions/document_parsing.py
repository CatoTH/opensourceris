    # STRING NORMALIZATION
    #

    # Strings must be normalized before searching and matching them. This includes

    # normalization (e.g. stemming) and content normalization (e.g. synonym
    # handling).

    # NAMES
    #

    # Many places can be referred to using just their name, for example specific
    # buildings (e.g. the Brandenburger Tor), streets (Hauptstra√üe) or other
    # points of interest. These can be extracted using the ``NameExtractor``.
    #
    # Note that extractor will automatically receive the (normalized) location
    # names from the pipeline we construct later, so there's no need to explicitly
    # pass them to the constructor.

    #
    # PATTERNS
    #

    # For locations that are notated using a semi-structured format (addresses)
    # the ``PatternExtractor`` is a good choice. It looks for matches of regular
    # expressions.
    #
    # The patterns should have named groups, their sub-matches will be
    # returned in the extracted locations.

    # POSTPROCESSING
    #

    # to remove certain attributes that are useful for validation but are not
    # intended for publication. Or you may want to remove a certain address that's
    # printed in the footer of all the documents you're processing.
    #
    # GeoExtract allows you to do this by using one or more postprocessors. In this
    # example we will remove all but a few keys from our location dicts.

    # PIPELINE CONSTRUCTION
    #

    # A pipeline connects all the different components.
    #
    # Here we're using custom extractors and a custom normalizer. We could also
    # provide our own code for splitting a document into chunks and for validation,
    # but for simplicity we'll use the default implementations in these cases.
